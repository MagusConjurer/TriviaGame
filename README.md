# TriviaGame
A jQuery trivia game

This was our third personal project for the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

Each round you get 15 seconds to guess which play the Shakespeare quote is from. When the time runs out, you will also be shown the correct answer if you guessed wrong. 

After five quotes, you can see the total number of times you were correct, wrong or did not select a quote. You can then try again and get an additional five quotes.

There are 15 quotes in total. Each round picks 5 random quotes from the list. Each quote has four answers that are shuffled when you start the round.
